I'm Jeremy, the one who writes for the site. The goal for this site is to illustrate surprising connections between branches of mathematics (and also physics). I love working on theoretical topics, and it's even better when the topics have nice analogs that one can easily visualize. I think this is a big drawback for people who are interested in mathematics and physics, but just can't seem to _see_ the concepts in their minds. My goal is to change that, and illuminate the wonder in both mathematics and physics. I firmly believe that one can view mathematics as a black box that churns out wonderful results, _or_ one can dig deeper into the black box and understand what is going on. My desire is always to understand, and to try and communicate that understanding as clearly as possible.

As for what I do other than writing, I am currently a physics and mathematics student. However, while I love both subjects, I of course try not to limit myself to them. I enjoy many other subjects, such as computer science, biology, and even non-science subjects like design and philosophy. Really, I like being stimulated mentally, and it just so happens that I pursue that through physics and mathematics primarily.

## Site Details

I'm currently hosted by GitHub, and I'm running the fantastic Pixyll theme (modified to my liking).
