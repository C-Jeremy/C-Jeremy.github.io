Do you enjoy mathematics and science?

Do you think society would do better if mathematics and science were emphasized more?

I'm Jeremy, and this site is for those who are mathematically and scientifically curious. These topics don't *have* to be black boxes where we have to accept the results without any knowledge. I believe every one can and should know a little bit about mathematics and science. Just like we think reading and writing skills are required for everyone, having basic knowledge about these subjects is critical.

The site deals with related topics, such as education within these two spheres, and the way mathematics and science can inform the way we live our lives. I'm not silly enough to believe that these disciplines have *all* the answers, but it's important to have some understanding of them, because they are in use around us each and every day. In particular, science is changing our world, and its easy to get bewildered by the endless technological innovations that happen because of it. Hopefully, this blog will be an oasis of understanding.

Thanks for finding your way to the site. I hope you stay. If you want a direct connection to the blog, subscribe through RSS. I respect your time, so there aren't any advertisements or any other distractions. There are only words (and an occasional illustration). This is a labour of love. My gift to you, the reader.
