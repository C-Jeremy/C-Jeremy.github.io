Have you ever found yourself glimpsing a reality that seems to be invisible to everyone else?

![Mathematics *everywhere*!](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto,w_600/v1531855231/MathematicsEverywhere.png){: .centre-image }

This feeling occurs all the time once you start learning about mathematics and science. You start to realize that there is a hidden world of richness all around you that most people don't even know about!

This site is for those who are curious, and want to learn more about mathematics and science. These topics don't *have* to be black boxes. Understanding them gives us small glimpses into the wonderful world around us and worlds which are only possible within our minds.

The site deals with related topics, such as education within these two spheres, and the way mathematics and science can inform the way we live our lives. I'm not silly enough to believe that these disciplines have *all* the answers, but it's important to have some understanding of them, because they are in use around us each and every day. In particular, science is changing our world, and its easy to get bewildered by the endless technological innovations that happen because of it. Hopefully, this blog will be an oasis of understanding.

Thanks for finding your way to the site. I hope you stay. If you want a direct connection to the blog, subscribe through [RSS](https://jeremycote.me/feed). I respect your time, so there aren't any advertisements or any other distractions. There are only words (and an occasional illustration). This is a labour of love. My gift to you, the reader.
