Hey there!

I&#8217;m Jeremy, the one who writes for the site. I&#8217;m most interested in mental models, how we communicate, the aspects of good teaching, actuallyÂ _learning_ as a student, and how to be a great coach. I think many of these things overlap, and I enjoy thinking about how they intersect with my two great passions in life: science and sport. I think both offer great lessons on life, and I hope that you enjoy joining me on the road to learning about them. I&#8217;m a life-long learner, and I hope that if you&#8217;re reading this that you are, too.

As for what I do, I&#8217;m currently a student in the sciences. My domain of choice is physics, particularly astrophysics, so you may need to forgive my generous use of the examples from the great cosmos. It&#8217;s just how I like to roll. I enjoy opening my mind to new roads of thought, and science is the way that I go about it. Hopefully, you may even learn something from all my science-talk!
