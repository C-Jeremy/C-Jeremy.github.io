I&#8217;m trying to help my brother with his mathematics homework, and I find he&#8217;s struggling to understand what he should do. I try to nudge him in the right direction (without giving him the answer, of course), but he shrugs off my help. Frustrated because he _knows_ I have the answer, he tells me, &#8220;Just give me the formula. That&#8217;s all I need.&#8221;

I try to maintain my composure (helping siblings can sometimes be a tricky experience), and say, &#8220;But you don&#8217;t _need_ a formula. You just have to think about what you&#8217;re trying to find.&#8221; However, I can see that he&#8217;s having none of it, and just wants me to tell him the answer so that he can look around on his memory aid and &#8220;find&#8221; the path to the correct answer. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/08/just-give-me-the-formula/" title="Permanent Link: Just Give Me the Formula" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
