Each day, you make a bunch of different choices. Most of them will have some sort of impact on you, both your present _and_ future self. By making a certain choice, &#8220;each&#8221; self will be affected, so it makes sense that both &#8220;iterations&#8221; of you will be considered in the decision. However, we both know this isn&#8217;t what happens. Most of the time, you&#8217;ll make a decision that I can even predict: it&#8217;ll be the one that serves your _present_ needs more readily, with little regard to your &#8220;future&#8221; self. Often, your future self may not even register within your mind.

This is an obvious problem, because how are we supposed to achieve our long-term goals if we&#8217;re always making decisions that hinder our future selves?
