There seems to be a resurgence in the idea that students can learn without being constricted to a classroom, that they should be free to pursue learning anything that makes them curious. The rationale is that a curious student will love what he or she is learning, instead of slowly being told that they _must_ learn it.

This sentiment has echos for me on my thoughts about running. If I was forced to go outside and run a lot at a young age, I don&#8217;t know if I would be enjoying running as I do today. More likely, I think, would be that I&#8217;d dread running because it would be another chore to complete, something else to get done.

Contrast that with my attitude towards running now, and there&#8217;s a stark difference. I couldn&#8217;t be more in love with running than I am. It&#8217;s one of the most fulfilling activities in my life. Yet, I can very well imagine what would happen if I was _told_ to run, instead of discovering it on my own. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/29/science-education-and-self-learning/" title="Permanent Link: Science Education and Self Learning" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
