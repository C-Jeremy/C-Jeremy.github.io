I&#8217;ve written about this before, but I&#8217;ve gone through most of my school years labeled as &#8220;the smart one&#8221;. Since it&#8217;s a mostly positive label, I haven&#8217;t take particular issue with it. At the same time, I also accepted the term of &#8220;athlete&#8221;. These two terms have been the ones that surround me as I made my way through school, and they still do. Whether or not I like them, they&#8217;re the ones that have been ascribed to me.

However, _I_ know I am much more than just an athlete and a &#8220;smart person&#8221;. I write, I read, I have an interest in everything to do with science, but I also am interested in design and technology. I have many different interests that are all but invisible to the majority of people who meet me. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/22/defining/" title="Permanent Link: Defining" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
