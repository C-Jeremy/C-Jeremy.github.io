In a race, there can be a winner and a bunch of losers. This is because of one simple fact: everyone starts at the same line, at the same time.

There aren&#8217;t any runners who get some special advantage and get to run less distance. That would be ridiculous, and would ruin the whole notion of competition and comparison. In a race, everyone begins on equal ground, at the same time.

The problem is, a race isn&#8217;t like life.

None of us start our journey at the same point, yet we _always_ compare ourselves as if we did. When we are beginners, do we look to other beginners for comparison to see how we&#8217;re doing? Of course not. We look to the masters who have been doing great things in their craft for years. It&#8217;s only natural. They are the best, and so they are some of the most inspiring for those of us who want to do great things as well. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/06/03/improvement-is-not-a-race/" title="Permanent Link: Improvement is Not a Race" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
