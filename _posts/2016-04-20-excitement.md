The greatest thing you can give your audience is a reason to be excited.

Sure, communicating with the aim of transmitting information is good. However, if we want to _maximize_ the information that is being recalled, as well as get them to be _proactive_ in their learning, we need to be mindful of how we&#8217;re communicating. In other words, we need to be excited _and_ convey that excitement to our audience.

What does this look like? It means being dynamic in your communication, varying your methods and examples given. It means being _enthusiastic_, which is a quality that needs to be outwardly expressed in order to register with your audience. You don&#8217;t have to be bubbly, but being engaged and lively about your subject is definitely a good start. This is _particularly_ true if you&#8217;re an expert in your subject. Even if you&#8217;ve read and learned about a particular component before, this could be the first time for your audience. Take advantage of that first exposure, and make them see why they should be excited. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/04/20/excitement/" title="Permanent Link: Excitement" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
