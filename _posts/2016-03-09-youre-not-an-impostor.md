# <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">It&#8217;s </span><em style="font-size: 16px;">so</em><span style="font-size: 16px;"> easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re doing when we first begin our journey into our craft.</span></span>

_With so many others in this craft already, why am I here? What can I possibly contribute?_

These questions can worry you at first, for they play right into the fear of being an impostor. And no one wants to be an impostor.

However, as Sean McCabe writes (link): &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be an expert in order to teach. You only have to know more than the person you are teaching.&#8221;

This is a profound statement, because it flips the whole notion of teaching on its head. No longer do you have to have a degree or certification to necessarily teach. Instead, you have to possess good communication skills, and interest in the subject, and a feeling of responsibility towards your students. As long as you know more than the person you are teaching, you can be _seen_ as an expert. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/03/09/youre-not-an-impostor/" title="Permanent Link: You&#8217;re Not an Impostor" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
