There&#8217;s _always_ a way to burn away your passion for your craft.

I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re an Olympic athlete, or a weekend warrior. You can be the best at your craft or mediocre at best. _No one_ is immune to this.

Just like a food you once loved can suddenly become nauseating after a traumatic incident, you can push yourself hard enough that the craft no longer has any appeal. It&#8217;s not easy, but it can happen if you aren&#8217;t careful with how immersed you are in the craft and the amount of pressure you place on yourself.

On the one hand, that pressure can help you improve. On the other hand, you may begin to equate your craft with a lot of pressure, which naturally induces stress. A delicate balance, then, is needed if you want to see improvement without pushing yourself away. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/06/22/the-kill-shot/" title="Permanent Link: The Kill Shot" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
