Through my two years in a CÃ‰GEP science program, I learned an important lesson about the nature of my education. The simple truth is that it&#8217;s possible to go through the program without any intuition.

Said differently: one could pass by only relying on being skilled in mathematics. The nature of a science education revolves around three components: assignments, labs, and exams. As a result, everything that is marked in a science class revolves around getting the logic (usually, in the form of mathematics) right. As long as one is well-versed in mathematics, it is possible to do well in a science course.

How did I see this? Mainly, it occurred when I saw people who were uninterested in a subject[^1]. The way it&#8217;s expressed in physics is through a lack of interest in an intuitive answer. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/01/intuition/" title="Permanent Link: Intuition" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
