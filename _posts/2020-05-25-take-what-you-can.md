When I was younger, I wanted to understand everything that was taught to me in class. If the teacher presented it, I wanted to understand it. I was determined to get *everything*. This extended throughout my secondary and undergraduate education, where I made sure I could do everything that was asked of me.

For my master's degree, I joined a theoretical physics program that is quite different than the norm. One of the hallmarks of the program is its quickness.

Classes are very short (they tend to be about a month long), which means a lot of content gets covered in a short period. Unlike some of the others, I did not have prior exposure to most of the content, so I was getting everything from scratch. This was great in terms of raw information being thrown at me, but it also meant I couldn't absorb it all. There was just too much.

My younger self would have become frustrated. I would have resisted, working myself non-stop to understand everything that came up. I also would have been on the path to burnout.

At first, I tried to follow my usual route. It didn't go well. The rapidity of the classes was too high to have time to sit down and absorb it all. So I quickly came to a decision: I wasn't going to feel bad if I didn't get everything. In fact, I would embrace the mindset of taking what I could from classes, and nothing more. If I only understood a few things from a lecture, that was okay. If I didn't develop a precise understanding of all the topics over the course of the class, that was fine too. My goal was simple: understand a few things, and that's it.

You might read this and think that it's the attitude of someone who gave up. I would argue that it's the attitude of someone who knows their limits. There's no need to push yourself for the sake of your ego. Understanding a bunch of topics is great, but it can easily fall over into trying to understand *too* many things at once. At that point, you're not helping yourself.

This mindset offered so much more freedom to me. It allowed me to see that I wasn't a failure if I struggled to keep up with the rapid pace that new ideas were flung at me. Instead, I just had to do my best to absorb what I could, and move on with that.

I like to think of it as adopting a zen attitude. I don't worry as much about only getting a few ideas. Actually, it helps me focus when I'm listening to a presentation or am in a class.

I have to admit that my particular situation does help. In my program, everything is pass/fail, so there's no incentive to pretending you know everything for the sake of a good grade. I have the luxury of choosing a few ideas that interest me and try to understand those. It's a privilege that I know exists for me.

But I think this way of operating is much closer to what you need to do outside of school. Having a little bit of knowledge of a lot of things is good, but being able to go deeper on a few topics is what really distinguishes you from others.

That's why I don't even pretend to myself that I'll get all of the finer details from a course anymore. Instead, I simply take what I can, and am happy with that.
