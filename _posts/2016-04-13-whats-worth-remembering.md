In almost every class I&#8217;ve ever taken, I&#8217;ve had to remember some kind of information. Whether it was dates for history, facts for science, or passages from books for English, memorization has been part of my student experience.

Recently though, I&#8217;ve started to question what exactly _should_ be required to know for tests, particularly in the sciences.

The most common answer I get to the question of why we must memorize information is that it&#8217;s &#8220;important&#8221;. Therefore, we should need to remember it, so the logic goes. This was particularly surprising in mathematics, where we had to memorize various formulas in order to answer questions on the test.

This is where my first problem comes. As far as I&#8217;ve been able to tell, there&#8217;s absolutely _no_ value in memorizing formulas for mathematics or any other science course. Honestly, there&#8217;s no reason, and it just makes students stressed even more. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/04/13/whats-worth-remembering/" title="Permanent Link: What&#8217;s Worth Remembering" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
