In the end, our best idea can only be an approximation.

Once we realize this, we can be freed by the shackle of perfectionism, content with doing the best we can instead of declaring ideas as &#8220;absolute truths&#8221;. The unfortunate reality is that _anything_ we try to measure or quantify has inherent uncertainty in it. That&#8217;s just the way our scientific process works. We measure to the best of our ability, and then identify the uncertainties. This allows us to get the &#8220;best idea we can at a given point in time&#8221;.

The point isn&#8217;t to be perfect. After we&#8217;ve established this, the focus goes to reducing our uncertainties. Yet at the same time, we _know_ that they can never be zero, since _any_ method of measurement has some uncertainty. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/04/22/approximation/" title="Permanent Link: Approximation" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
