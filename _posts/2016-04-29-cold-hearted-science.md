If you read nearly any kind of literature in the past few centuries, you may notice an interesting pattern. In many of them, the concept of science is looked down upon, as if science is something to be disdained. Instead of being heralded as one of the most important endeavours in human history, a common thread people attach themselves to is that of the mystery-killer.

Science kills the mystique of the world, so they say.

This has always greatly angered me. Like [Richard Feynman](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/?utm_content=buffer2fc27&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer), I _detested_ this idea. I&#8217;ve found it to be simply untrue (even to the point of being the direct _opposite_ of what I feel science to be). This thought has literary stems that have pierced through many cultures, and that is why science has been looked down upon. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/04/29/cold-hearted-science/" title="Permanent Link: Cold-Hearted Science" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
