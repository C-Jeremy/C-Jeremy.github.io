The most dangerous weapon is a little bit of science.

Most people can agree that ignorance is a bad thing. After all, if you don&#8217;t know the latest information about a subject, how are you supposed to competently assess or form some kind of argument about the subject? It&#8217;s like arguing that the Earth is the centre of the cosmos because you haven&#8217;t ever looked at celestial data that proves otherwise. For this, most people will say that you do not know what you&#8217;re talking about, and that the leading theory is that the universe is generally homogenous and isotropic [^1].

The problem comes in when people with a little science start asserting facts as if they are experts. Now, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to be a _complete_ expert on a scientific subject, but there&#8217;s a point in which you transition from a novice to an expert. Before this point, you may have a small amount of scientific knowledge, but not enough to be extremely competent with all of the details. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/01/13/a-little-is-worse-than-nothing/" title="Permanent Link: A Little is Worse Than Nothing" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
