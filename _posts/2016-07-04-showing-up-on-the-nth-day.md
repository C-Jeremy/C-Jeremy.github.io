It&#8217;s easy to put a big effort in one day. Yes, it takes effort, but it&#8217;s not overly difficult. If you wanted, you could write for the whole day, or run for three hours, or practice a musical instrument. When it&#8217;s just one day, it&#8217;s no big deal, right?

Of _course_ one day is easy. The situation is both finite in nature and approachable. Yes, it may suck to do it, but a day isn&#8217;t going to kill you. You can count down the hours in a day without too much trouble.

The bigger challenge, then, is to show up the next day. And the subsequent one. And the one after that. (Particularly, when no one but you seems to care about your effort.)

When the scope of the commitment increases from one day to the _nth_ day, there is inherent uncertainty in the proposition. It may feel like the commitment is never going to end, or that it will eventually seem like just another chore to complete every day. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/04/showing-up-on-the-nth-day/" title="Permanent Link: Showing Up On the Nth Day" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
