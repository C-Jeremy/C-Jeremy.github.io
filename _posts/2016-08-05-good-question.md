As a science student, I've taken many tests over the years. The staple of a science class _is_ the tests that are spread out over a semester, so they are to be expected. Consequently, I've answered many questions on tests, and so I have a fair idea about which questions are actually good questions to ask on tests, and which ones seem like there is no point.

## Why have tests?

First of all, I should establish why I think we even _have_ tests. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that most science classes are lecture based, meaning there is a lot of information coming in to the student. To be sure that this information is retained by the student, tests are given (and are the easiest way to do so). <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/05/good-question/" title="Permanent Link: What&#8217;s in a Good Question?" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
