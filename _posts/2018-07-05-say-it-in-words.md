![Say it in words.](http://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto/v1529777421/Say_It_In_English.png)

It's easy to get caught up in the technical details of whatever you're working on. Something isn't working, and you're not quite sure what needs to be done to fix it.

When this happens, it can be helpful to take a step back and ask, "How can I explain this to someone who has no background?" This isn't an easy task. In fact, when I ask this of those I tutor in mathematics, they have a lot of trouble with it. Decoupling the terminology from the concept isn't a simple matter of swapping a few words for the "plain" version. To do this successfully, you need to have an understanding of the subject that is more than just surface-level.

I'm not suggesting that the plain version will give you insight into how to solve the problem. However, it often draws the essence out of the problem and frames it in a new perspective. It's this perspective that can lead to new strategies. These wouldn't have been found by staring at the technical details.

Nothing beats digging into the technical aspects of a problem, but it's not the *only* way to tackle it. Taking a step back and explaining it to someone who has no experience in the subject can be illuminating.
