If we were in the fourth century and I told you that the Earth was flat, a reasonable question you could ask me would be, "If you just continued moving in one direction, would you just eventually fall off?"

Now, that wasn't what I said at the beginning. I simply said the Earth was flat. However, the logical _implication_ of a flat Earth means that there is an edge to it (unless, of course, it is infinite). Apart from the infinity loophole, there is _no_ other way out of this option. Either the Earth is infinitely flat or it has an edge.

Suppose you want to test my question because you are sure you are correct. You say, "Alright, we will continue moving in one direction, and we'll eventually arrive at the edge, proving what I say is true." From there, the we begin our journey. Assuming we can somehow move in exactly one direction without being obstructed, we would eventually return where you left on. Therefore, this would invalidate my hypothesis. The Earth could not be flat, or else we would have detected an edge. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/09/05/logical-implications/" title="Permanent Link: Logical Implications" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
