When you have a lot of homework, it's tempting to just look up the answers. After all, you're doing it because you want to get *other* homework done, right? And if you take the time to read through the solutions, it's good enough. You aren't copying down answers. You're following the work that is done.

While the above situation sounds good in theory, in practice it is a *terrible* way to try to learn. It's easy enough to find solutions to mathematics and science problems online, but finding them diminishes the value of the problems.

If we compare the learning that happens due to working through a problem and the learning the happens due to reading a solution, I'm sure our intuitions will be correct. Working through a problem is a much better use of our time, even though it isn't efficient.

We've all been there: gazing at a problem, frustrated that the answer won't present itself to us. Then, usually just a few centimetres away lies a device that can *find* the solution for us. Why struggle when you can get through the small hurdle and continue on the problem?

The practical answer[^1]: tests.

Sure, it is nice to be able to look up just a "hint" to help you complete the problem that has been frustrating you for the last half hour. However, the issue is that the "hint" often gives away the crux of the problem. Rarely are problems created *solely* to test your ability to calculate one thing. Instead, they're made to tackle specific concepts and make sure a student can recognize them. By turning to hints and help every time those points of confusion are reached, you're robbing yourself of the skill needed to come up with an insight during a test.

Let's consider an even more extreme idea: only reading a complete solution to a problem instead of even attempting it. While I am certain you will understand the solution (as you should, since that's the point of a well-written solution), your ability to get the answer without any help has not improved. Instead, you're fooling yourself into understanding how to do a problem, while the truth is that you understand someone *else's* solution to a problem.

Still, these online resources are good for something. I use them to verify my answers when I am done working on a problem. I try to avoid doing what I described in the preceding paragraphs, because I know that when I reach a point of difficulty on a test, I can't just magically skip to the next line of my solution like I can do when reading the answer. That blank space needs to be overcome first, and making the effort to practice writing full solutions by yourself without help is the key to being able to solve problems on your own.

Don't just read solutions. Get good at *making* them.

[^1]: For a less practical answer, think about the situations where you need to solve a *new* problem. There won't be a solution manual to look at, so you need to get good at solving problems on your own.
