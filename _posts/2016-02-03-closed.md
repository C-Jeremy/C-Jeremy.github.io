This happens to _everyone_:

You are passionately debating a topic with another person who has views that you just _cannot_ agree with for the life of you. The perspective is so out there that you don&#8217;t even want to think about it. Therefore, as they try to argue their point, you barely register what they say. Instead, you&#8217;re already attempting to argue _your_ side of the debate.

I think we&#8217;ve all been there before.

The problem with this situation is that we _automatically shut people out before even analyzing their arguments_. Instead of listening, _really_ listening, to what they are saying, we close ourselves off to it because the view is too alien to our own. It&#8217;s as if, by simply engaging with an opposite view, we are going to taint our own. Instead of being open-minded, we stay closed. In essence, we are almost _scared_ of what these &#8220;others&#8221; have to say. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/03/closed/" title="Permanent Link: Closed" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
