Trying to solve the problem all at once is complicated, and usually too messy. When trying to solve something in one step, it&#8217;s easy to make mistakes or otherwise fail. It&#8217;s the nature of trying to figure out faster ways to perform tasks.

It&#8217;s the same way for your goals. On the one hand, you can attempt to take on too much, too soon. You can fill your schedule up with your goal to such an extent that everything becomes overwhelming. At that point, odds are you will stumble backwards from the pressure of it all.

If you want to look at the masters for inspiration, you will see this strategy all the time. Rarely will a master attack a problem head on, because they know it won&#8217;t work. Instead, they develop a methodical strategy to slowly get part of the problem solved, one step at a time. This is because it is much easier to handle a small part of the problem than trying to deal with the whole thing at one time. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/11/slowly-chipping-away/" title="Permanent Link: Slowly Chipping Away" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
