One of the easiest things to do when we're confronted with something new is to generalize. How does what I just saw apply to my life? Can I spot a general pattern?

It's tempting to extrapolate from a small sample size, but we need to resist. The reason is that you can fit infinitely many lines to a single point. A single point does not define a pattern. Furthermore, a handful of points doesn't do that much of a better job.

In science, we call this the problem of N = 1. If our sample size is one, we can't make too many scientific statements about the population of interest. New data could make the trends go in any which way. The conclusion is that more data is needed. Responsible scientists *don't* start making wild claims from a sample size of one.

This idea is applicable to more than just the scientific realm. We love picking up on patterns. It's what we do. This makes us prone to committing the N = 1 mistake.

When making decisions and judgments, keep in mind the data at your disposal. If the data is weak or nonexistent, it can be dangerous to extrapolate from a single point. If you want to deal with data responsibly, you need to be careful when making interpretations.
