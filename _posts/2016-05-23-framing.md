Imagine any given day. There are _so_ many ways to describe this event. You can describe it as the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same point in the sky. You can describe it in hours (24), or minutes (1440), or even seconds (86400). Zooming out further, a day can be just a seventh of a week, or a small portion of a month or a year. It&#8217;s all a question of perspective.

Now imagine a day in terms of a year. It&#8217;s only one out of three-hundred-sixty-five days. Not much, right? But then think about a simple week, which doesn&#8217;t feel _that_ long. Suddenly, the week takes up a fiftieth of the year, much more than just a single day. Instead of feeling like a small portion of a year, the week is much larger. There aren&#8217;t that many in a year, huh? <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/05/23/framing/" title="Permanent Link: Framing" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
