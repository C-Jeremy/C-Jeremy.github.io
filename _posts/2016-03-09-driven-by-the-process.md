Most of us start practicing a craft because we have a goal. However, the ones who _stay_ in the craft stay because they love the process.

It&#8217;s relatively easy to set yourself a goal and stick with it. After all, you only have to pledge a small amount of time in order to get the payoff. You can see this from those who run marathons over four hours and more on their first attempt. Realistically, they probably weren&#8217;t as ready for a marathon as they could have been by beginning with shorter distances and building up the strength needed. But instead, they wanted the payoff of &#8220;training&#8221; for a marathon and then completing it, no matter the time. That is why you see so many runners hitting over four hours for the marathon. It&#8217;s in most of them to go faster, but they chose to forgo the long and slow buildup for something much quicker. Then they&#8217;re happy to call themselves a marathoner, even though they&#8217;ve put in a fraction of the work that others have[^1]. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/03/09/driven-by-the-process/" title="Permanent Link: Driven by the Process" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
