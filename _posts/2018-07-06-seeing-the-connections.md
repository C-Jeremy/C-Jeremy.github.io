As a tutor, I get to peak into the minds of many of my students and get a chance to see how *they* perceive certain problems while they are new to the subject. It's an endlessly fascinating experience, because I get to broaden the way I look at many problems. My students tend to be in secondary school, so the manipulations they do are second-nature for me. This isn't surprising, since I've worked with science and mathematics for around a decade, which means a lot of it is ingrained.

However, it's not second-nature for my students, which is why I help them. What I find interesting though is how they come up with the answers they do. For example, I have to teach algebraic manipulation to many of my students. It isn't obvious to them how you move terms from one end of an equation to the other.  In my eyes, it's obvious, since each movement fits together like a puzzle. The challenge, therefore, is to resolve how I see these manipulations in a way that my students understand what I'm doing. I see it as a fun challenge.

However, a common thread that I see between those who struggle with mathematics is that they miss the connections between ideas. For things that many of us take for granted, such as multiplication and division or subtraction and addition, we forget that not *everyone* sees the connection. I've had students in which I could be pretty sure they did not see the relation between addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division.

Sometimes, we just don't know what we are looking at, even if it's jumping right out in front of us.

The above example may seem simplistic, but it occurs *everywhere* in mathematics. The trouble is that we *don't* see the connections when we are stuck, so we can mistakenly think there aren't any. I remember my mathematics teacher, while teaching us a concept and trying to show that a previous term reemerged in these new equations, said, "*Look!* It's saying, 'Look at me, I'm right here!'" Without this prodding, the connection might not have been made.

Mathematics is about finding the connections between disparate ideas, and this often extends into science as well. If we aren't open to seeing these new connections (and trying our best to find out what we are missing), we will lose out on the best that mathematics and science have to offer.
