Most of the time, it&#8217;s used as a crutch. Instead of actually seeking a person&#8217;s advice and acting on it, we tend to look for _more_ advice, as if the first person didn&#8217;t offer enough. We then move from person to person, trying to understand the situation from more angles.Â Unfortunately, this strategy only results in paralysis.

We end up searching for advice in order to _not_ have to make a decision. We can then defend our acts, saying that we were simply looking for more balanced viewpoints. The problem is that this continues on forever, since there&#8217;s _always_ something you haven&#8217;t considered. That&#8217;s the reality of life. We only have a small torch in a large cave, and at one point we have to make a decision and move in a direction.

Seeking advice, therefore, is more of a crutch than anything else. A recipe for paralysis. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/22/advice-on-advice/" title="Permanent Link: Advice on Advice" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
