In secondary mathematics, students are allowed to prepare their own memory aid for an exam. It must be handwritten and can only cover one piece of paper. Usually, this memory aid is used to write formulas or challenging examples of different concepts so that one isn't lost when writing an exam.

As a tutor, I have some experience advising others on their memory aids (as well as my own time being a secondary student, of course). I've seen some memory aids that were nearly blank and some that were filled to the brim. Both approaches can work, and it entirely depends on the person. 

However, one thing I've seen time and time again is a tendency for one to write down the formula _as provided by a formal definition_. This is an important note, because a formal definition can be _much_ more confusing to a student than the rigorous definition. And, as the students I've tutored tend to have difficulties in the subject of mathematics, these definitions can make little sense. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/03/memory-aids/" title="Permanent Link: Memory Aids" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
