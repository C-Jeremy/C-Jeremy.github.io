As I was tutoring one of my students about algebra, I could see that he was struggling with making sense of the rules of how to manipulate equations in order to solve for a given variable. The equation involved fractions and like terms, and looked something like this:
  
$$\frac{3}{5}x+17=2x-\frac{1}{8}$$

He was having trouble with doing his steps in order. For example, he was dividing to solve for &#8220;x&#8221; before he placed all the other terms on the other side.

To be honest, it was a bit of a challenge for me to address, because I had so much experience working with basic equations such as these that the process was basically automatic. I knew the steps I took to get there, though, so that&#8217;s what I told him. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/08/these-rules-are-stupid/" title="Permanent Link: These Rules Are Stupid" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
