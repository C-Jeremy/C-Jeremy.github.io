Imagine you lived in a place where you couldn't say _anything_ to contradict the person who somehow gained power in that region. What if you couldn't even question something that they said which was _plainly_ wrong? What if the consequence of questioning resulted in you being punished, either physically or mentally?

I have a good guess about what might happen: you'd slowly learn to not question what was said. At first, you'd probably think about your objections in your head, mulling over them as the person says ridiculous things, but after a while you'll begin to not think about it as much. Sooner or later, you won't even question what is being said.
