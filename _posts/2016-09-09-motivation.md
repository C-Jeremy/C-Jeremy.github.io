When I first began my CÃ‰GEP mathematics courses, one of the things I noticed that was new was how my teacher would give "motivation" to what we're doing. Basically, the idea was to give us a _reason_ for why we were doing something, instead of just throwing it out in the blue.

This was a welcome change from what I originally did in secondary school. There was some motivation for what we were doing, but most of the motivation was left up to us to find. We simply went from one subject to another. With my teacher in college however, there was nearly _always_ some sort of motivation embedded into the lecture. Some of it might have went over our heads, but my teacher always made sure to give us _some_ reason for what we did. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/09/09/motivation/" title="Permanent Link: Motivation" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
