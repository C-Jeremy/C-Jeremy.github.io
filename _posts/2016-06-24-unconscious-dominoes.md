We are packets of movements, repeated every single day. In essence, we are periodic, operating on cycles that make us beings of habit.

Think about the things you do daily that are automatic. You wake up, maybe make yourself some breakfast, and check your news feeds. You don&#8217;t _only_ check your news feeds, and you _never_ do it before you make your breakfast. Every day, it&#8217;s the same movements, the same habits, _in the same cycle_. One action leads to another, without you having to think about it.

Wake up, make breakfast, check your feeds.

However, these distractions aren&#8217;t random. As soon as you&#8217;re on your computer and you get bored, you&#8217;re typing the words of your favourite site before your brain even realizes what it&#8217;s doing. Even worse, your mental energy is so depleted that you don&#8217;t even stop yourself from continuing. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/06/24/unconscious-dominoes/" title="Permanent Link: Unconscious Dominoes" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
