Every day, you change as a person. You do something just a little different than the day before. It&rsquo;s not large. In mathematics, it&rsquo;s called an infinitesimal change. Day to day, this change is so small that it is difficult to discern.

But string a few of these days together, until you have about one hundred days. Chances are, you have made some changes to yourself in three months. In fact, it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed. Yet at the same time, it feels like you didn&rsquo;t change from one day to the next. The transition was so smooth and fluid, you did not even notice there _was_ a transition.

Think of a circle. Imagine you&rsquo;re at one point on the circle, and that each day, you move to the next point on the circle. Day to day, you won&rsquo;t see much change in terms of your position. However, give yourself a long time, and eventually you&rsquo;ll see that you have gotten far away from where you originally were. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2015/12/12/iteration-2/" title="Permanent Link: Iteration" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
