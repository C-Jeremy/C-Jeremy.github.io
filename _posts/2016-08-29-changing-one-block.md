If I ask many people, I can probably get one person to admit that they believe in something that isn't strictly speaking scientific. It could be large parts of our universe, such as the existence of an afterlife or a soul, or it could be smaller things such as our horoscopes actually telling us information about ourselves. There are many beliefs that humans have, and it isn't uncommon to find someone harbouring at least _one_ of these beliefs.

That said, I find it interesting how these people respond when being prodded about their beliefs. What I usually find is that people tend to not think about the logical consequences of their beliefs. Instead, when confronted with these inconsistencies, they will simply respond with: "I didn't say _that_ would happen. I'm only talking about _this_ specific thing being true." <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/29/changing-one-block/" title="Permanent Link: Changing One Block" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
