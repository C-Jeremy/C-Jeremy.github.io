At one point, anything can get filled so much that it becomes worse.

If one wants to be an expert at any discipline, the go-to answer has become _volume_. Do the work, do a lot of it, and you will see results. The more you do, the more experience and expertise you will gather, allowing you to improve. While true, I have personally seen the ill-effects of such a claim. It can make the most wonderful activity seem terrible and uninviting. It&#8217;s scary, because not many people think about a moment in which their passion is associated with anything but joy. However, this proclamation of volume can bring us close to such a situation.

The problem comes into play when we take into account the common constraint that everyone has: time. We each have the same amount in a day. No one gets special exceptions. This is a great equalizer, but it means it is also a container. Once that twenty-four-hour container is filled, nothing can be added in. Eventually, you will find a maximum density. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/01/22/density-2/" title="Permanent Link: Density" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
