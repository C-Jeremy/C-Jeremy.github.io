I&#8217;ve always been interested in a particular teaching technique that I think of as the &#8220;deception&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve experienced this sort of technique before, where it goes something like this:

The teacher asks, &#8220;How does this concept work?&#8221; The student responds with the correct answer, but they aren&#8217;t fully certain. Then, instead of agreeing and telling the student their answer is correct, they ask, &#8220;Are you _sure_?&#8221;

Suddenly, the student doesn&#8217;t seem as confident of their answer.

I&#8217;ve seen this happen on multiple occasions, and teachers seem to do this for different reasons. Some like to simply bug students, while others want to see how confident the students are in their answers. The goal, of course, is to get students to be sure of their answers without the need of a teacher&#8217;s approval. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/20/are-you-sure/" title="Permanent Link: Are You Sure?" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
