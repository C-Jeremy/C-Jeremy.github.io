It&#8217;s a nice idea, but the reality is that this never occurs. While we may enjoy an activity and say we love it more than any other, the love for it is not constant. Instead, it&#8217;s like a wave, with crests and troughs that occur at various times. However, unlike a wave it is more random. At times, the love for an activity may be at a maximum and stay there for weeks. During other stretches of time, motivation may be at a minimum, to the point that others would quit.

The trick, then, is to find a way to persevere despite these dips and surges in motivation and love for an activity. We know that breakthrough performances don&#8217;t occur in bursts, but during extended bouts of concentrated efforts. Therefore, relying on those crests and troughs to fuel the fire for your passion is not a great way to improve over the long term.
