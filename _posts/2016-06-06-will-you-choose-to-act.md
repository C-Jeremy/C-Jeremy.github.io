Before making this decision, you have to open your eyes to see that choice.

It&#8217;s too easy to just cruise along in your life, ignoring any opportunity to act. If you deliberately ignore opportunities, nothing will come of it. After all, you say, someone else will make decisions for me, right? And yes, you&#8217;d be right. People _will_ make decisions for you if you let them. However, whether or not those decisions will benefit _you_ is unclear and difficult to guarantee.

So yes, you can go through your life without choosing to act, deferring to other people when the opportunity for you to make a difference arises. That&#8217;s a path that will always be there for you. The default one. The path of least resistance. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/06/06/will-you-choose-to-act/" title="Permanent Link: Will You Choose to Act?" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
