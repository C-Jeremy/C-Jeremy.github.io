You have two choices when doubt comes your way.

One: You can panic, and let it control you. You can make rash decisions, not knowing what you&#8217;re doing because you&#8217;re just trying to make this _feeling_ go away. Doubt can then easily control you and make you stray away from your goals and your dreams.

_Or_.

Two: You can accept the doubt, and confront it head on. This isn&#8217;t exactly easier than the first option, but it _does_ give you control again. Doubt won&#8217;t go away, but it can sit in the background, away from your most important decisions. This way, you&#8217;re able to continue doing what you enjoy, even if the doubt is still there. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/24/doubt/" title="Permanent Link: Doubt" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
