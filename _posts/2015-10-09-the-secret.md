It’s not what most people want. It’s indeed there, but the truth of the secret would frustrate people. There is no quick fix. The secret isn’t a shortcut to a faster time, a better race. There is no such thing. If you want to be the best, you have to be capable of willing yourself to move faster than anyone else in the race.

That’s why the secret is so misleading. It is natural to assume that the secret has something to do with running faster in workouts. After all, that’s what makes us faster, right? We are a consequence of the workouts we do, and so more (and faster) workouts should increase our performance. Unfortunately, that’s not quite true.

We can convince ourselves that we are just so _close_, if only we ran some faster workouts. That we are at a precipice, just waiting to take a leap into the great unknown. All that is needed is to know the secret. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2015/10/09/the-secret/" title="Permanent Link: The Secret" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
