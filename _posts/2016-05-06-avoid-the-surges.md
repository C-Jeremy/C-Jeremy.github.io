When you first begin working on a goal or a habit (both after a break, or if you&#8217;re starting a new one), it&#8217;s tempting to do a lot. This is true for the beginner (once they have tested their abilities) as well as the veteran (who knows their ability far exceeds their modest comeback). Both want to push their abilities in order to challenge themselves. After all, who wants to be patient throughout a slow buildup when they can jump straight to the difficult things?

However, it&#8217;s so, _so_ important that you don&#8217;t fall into this trap. It&#8217;s seductive to begin doing more immediately, but you must remember that the goals we set are achieved over a _long_ period of time. You cannot &#8220;win&#8221; by doing everything in one day. Developing lifelong habits don&#8217;t happen that way. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/05/06/avoid-the-surges/" title="Permanent Link: Avoid the Surges" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
