It's not the beginning of a lesson.

One recurrent theme I've seen over and over is how teachers begin a session with showing a proof. The teacher jumps right into the lesson, saying, "This is the claim, and here's the proof for why it works and what it means."

Sure, this is a way to transmit the proof, but it's probably not the most effective way. Think about the situation from the perspective of the student. They are being introduced to a new piece of mathematics, and they have nothing to latch onto. There's no *hook*. The message is: just take down these notes, and understand the mechanics of how the proof works.

Instead, what if students were first represented with a question? This question would create a sense of engagement with the students, instead of them being passive receivers of knowledge. The question would prompt them to try and figure out possible solutions to the problem, and the proof becomes the *answer* to the question. The proof gets to be a natural extension of the discussion, not the first idea. This will also help teachers avoid the dreaded "What use is this *actually* going to give us?" question.

Remember, proofs aren't created out of thin air. They are *arguments*, answers to questions posed by people who wanted to figure out a particular problem. Therefore, why lead with a proof? Use the fact that it is a response to a question in order to stimulate discussion with the students.
