When I work with students, I often go through similar explanations for certain concepts that they struggle with. For example, if I'm working with a student on the concept of exponential functions (not the usual kind with *e*!), I'll often talk about money and investing. This is a good way for students to connect the abstract ideas to what is *actually* happening. I've found that this particular example illuminates exponential functions to students.

However, this isn't always true. Sometimes, there are explanations that are crystal-clear in my mind, yet they fall flat on their face when I present them to students. For whatever reason, the student doesn't respond well, even if I *know* the example is so perfect for the situation.

In those cases, I have a choice. I could keep on trying to push this example to the student. Maybe I'm convinced that I can get them to see how great it is. *Or*, I could change my tactics and move to a different example.

Most times, I *want* to choose the former option. Great ideas aren't easy to find, so when I find one, I latch onto it. However, I also know that pushing my examples onto students isn't the point of teaching them. Rather, the point is to give *any* example which will help them understand. If this means using a standard example instead of my super-creative-and-amazing one, I have to be okay with that. That's why I will chop my idea down and switch to something else if the student doesn't get it.

Students aren't all the same. Good teaching is about connecting with each one, not about sharing your own ideas. One of the most important lessons I remind myself over and over again is that *I* need to be flexible enough to address the issues that students have. If they can't understand the concept one way, it's up to me bridge that gap.
