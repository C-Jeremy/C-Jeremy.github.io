Turbulence is the norm of life. I might try my hardest to establish control, but I’ve learned that there will inevitably be breaks from my routine (and that’s coming from someone who *craves* routines!). This is true of my scientific, creative, and athletic pursuits. 

To combat this turbulence, I find it useful to have *daily anchors* in my life. What is an anchor? At its best, an anchor is an activity that you can pursue every day without outside expectation. It’s an activity that you do *because* you love it, with no other strings attached[^1].

A daily anchor is powerful because it gives you perspective. After a bad day, you can still say, “Well, at least I got to do X.” An anchor protects you from upheavals in life that would otherwise leave you unmoored.

But a daily anchor isn’t enough. One mistake that I made was focusing on only *one* anchor. For me, this was running. I ran every day, no matter the conditions. Rain, snow, or shine, I was there.

Unfortunately, a daily anchor makes you develop a dependence for it. No longer is it just something to keep you steady from day to day. It becomes something you *need*. A daily anchor becomes a part of your identity. Though I try to stay away from focusing on “who” I am (an identity) and instead focus on “what” I do (a pursuit), a daily anchor has a way of fusing them.

This means you can’t stop this pursuit at any time without affecting your identity. An anchor isn’t just a tool for stability, but it can also become a mass weighing you down.

## Anchors with an ‘s’

I realized that my troubles came from having *one* daily anchor. This meant my identity was glued to this activity. Take it away, and I wouldn’t know who I am. On the other hand, if I had multiple daily anchors, having to temporarily put one aside wouldn’t devastate my identity. Instead, it would simply mean a shift in focus to my *other* anchors, giving my identity a sort of redundancy.

Of course, it would be nice to tell you that I came upon this realization *before* anything bad happened, but that’s not true. Instead, I had a setback that took me away from running. I had to significantly reduce what I did, to the point that it didn’t even feel like I *was* a runner.

For someone whose identity was intertwined with running, this was devastating. Who was I without the running? I felt like an impostor.

It was painful, but also instructive. I set out to find other anchors that I could adopt, bringing more stability into my life. They came in the form of seeing my daily creative habit (of writing or drawing) as an anchor, as well as reading. I diversified, ensuring that a twist of life wouldn’t shock my sense of self.

Now, reading, writing, drawing, and running form the bedrock of my days. While it’s true that some of these are done in the service of others, the main reason I do them is because they fulfill me. When a bad day occurs (and they will always pop up), I can be confident that my anchors will keep me going. They give me a perspective on life. And they work best because their are *multiple*. While any one on its own is good, the power comes from having them reinforce each other.

Establish daily anchors, and when it seems like life threatens to shift, they can be the stability you need.

[^1]: This isn’t to say that you can’t have a good daily anchor which also has expectations. It’s just that, in its purest form, a daily anchor is for *you*.
