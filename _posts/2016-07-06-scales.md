Judgement comes in all the time, every day. There is no judgement &#8220;switch&#8221; in which you can flip on and off. Instead, there&#8217;s just judgement, all the time.

Consider writing a test. As soon as you get your test back, you look at the mark and you form a judgement. It&#8217;s quick, but it always happens. You see the number on your test, and you brain quickly analyzes it to tell you if you did well or not.

This may seem obvious, but consider what that judgement is based on. After all, judging is a _comparative_ thing. It&#8217;s hard to judge one thing without some sort of reference point. Saying that a person is intelligent doesn&#8217;t actually mean anything substantial, since the term is so loosely defined. Somewhere in that definition though, is a _comparison_.
