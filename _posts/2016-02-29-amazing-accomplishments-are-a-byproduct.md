In every domain, from sports to language to the arts, amazing work gets produced every day. If some sort of extra-terrestrial civilization were to somehow look into what gets circulated online at any given moment, they could almost be fooled into thinking everything humans do is great[^1].

But the problem with this situation is that the extra-terrestrial civilization is only seeing the _byproduct_ of doing good work. The reality is that the buzzer-beaters, masterpieces of music, and moving films aren&#8217;t _always_ made. They&#8217;re the consequence of hard work and a persistence in improving the craft.

In your domain, you surely practice often. Additionally, I&#8217;m quite confident that not _all_ of what you do is golden. There are bound to be rough drafts, or ideas that did not quite pan out as expected. Even for the work you _do_ share, there will certainly be pieces you enjoy more than others. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/29/amazing-accomplishments-are-a-byproduct/" title="Permanent Link: Amazing Accomplishments are a Byproduct" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
