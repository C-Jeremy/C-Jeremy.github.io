This is the default mode that most of us operate in, each day. The easiest behaviour is &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode, since it requires the least effort. This is the behaviour you would do every day out of habit. For most, this means doing a whole bunch of nothing. For a few hard-working people, this means doing what is routine for them.

However, &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode is something we _all_ want to avoid. The reason is that it makes us stay content with doing the same things, over and over again. On &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode, there aren&#8217;t any challenges. Sure, you may be _practicing_ your craft, but there isn&#8217;t anything pushing you out of your comfort zone. As such, the growth you get is minimal.

If our goal is to improve as people in our craft, this is a problem. Our _purpose_ is to become the best we can be, so cruising on autopilot isn&#8217;t exactly productive.
