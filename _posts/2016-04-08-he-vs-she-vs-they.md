We have an outdated approach to pronouns.

Technically speaking, if we are referring to a generic person, we should refer to this person as &#8220;he or she&#8221;. This is to keep the person as a universal entity, not shrouded by one specific gender[^1]. However, as one of my main philosophies about communication (and writing in particular) is &#8220;keep it brief&#8221;, I find the use of &#8220;he or she&#8221; to be completely absurd. It&#8217;s a nuisance when I write, and I always hated myself for doing it, even though it was _technically_ correct.

Fast forward to now, and I don&#8217;t care anymore. I&#8217;ve found the pronoun I&#8217;m going to use going forward, and it&#8217;s &#8220;they&#8221;. Anytime I see someone refer to people as &#8220;guys&#8221;, or to a person as &#8220;he&#8221;, I simply find it strange and exclusive. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/04/08/he-vs-she-vs-they/" title="Permanent Link: He vs. She vs. They" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
