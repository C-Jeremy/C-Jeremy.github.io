If you zoom in enough, _any_ curve can look straight.

Think about being on a curve that traces a circle. You&#8217;re at a specific point.Â Now, imagine just moving a little bit along that curve, taking an infinitesimally small step. You&#8217;ve barely moved. In fact, it may look like you&#8217;re not going to move in a circle at all. It may seem like you&#8217;re just moving straight, that you aren&#8217;t turning at all.

This is the trouble with zooming in too far with your goals. By analyzing one effort after another, it can seem like you didn&#8217;t accomplish much at all between yesterday and today. It can seem like you weren&#8217;t on a curve at all, but just a straight line. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/05/11/curves/" title="Permanent Link: Curves" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
