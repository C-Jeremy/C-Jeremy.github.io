I once had a mathematics teacher who would say something that bugged me: what we're doing is easy. I am barely being hyperbolic when I say that this teacher would say this for _every single concept_ we learned. Therefore, I couldn't help but think that surely not _everything_ could be this easy.

The saying would take on an ironic meaning to me, because even for the most difficult concepts we would learn in the class, my teacher still saw it as easy. I would frequently turn to my friend and exclaim, "How can it all be easy?"

He had no answer for me, and I thought that there wouldn't be one. However, after finishing the course and reflecting on my experience, I can start to see what my teacher was talking about. It's not that the concepts are super easy to understand. Instead, it's that the _leap_ from what we previously knew to what we learned is not huge, so it shouldn't be too difficult to understand the new material. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/10/building-on-top-of-each-other/" title="Permanent Link: Building On Top of Each Other" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
