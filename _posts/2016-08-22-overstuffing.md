When I was in CÃ‰GEP, I had to take a couple of complementary courses to get my degree. Due to the way my schedule was structured, I basically had no choice but to join a social science class. I've written about this class before, but there's one thing that I have to repeat: I am _not_ a social scientist, which means my lack of interest in the subject did not help for the boredom I experienced.

In this class, I had to read many texts that were technical (in the social science realm). Depending on your view of brief, they were around twenty to thirty pages, which isn't that long unless you dislike the subject such as myself. However, what I noticed about _all_ of them (I'm pretty sure I am not exaggerating here) was that they exhibited symptoms of being overstuffed. What I mean by this is that the author would use roundabout ways of explaining a point. Instead of a brief sentence, colourful metaphors were used (as if this was a novel). They also broke one of Orwell's rules for writing, which suggests that a writer should not use a complicated word when a simple one will do. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/22/overstuffing/" title="Permanent Link: Overstuffing" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
