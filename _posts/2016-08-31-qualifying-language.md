I used to _hate_ reading a text when someone would write with qualifying language (this was also prevalent in how many people I looked up to spoke). Why couldn't they just go ahead and _say_ the thing that they wanted to say? Why did their have to be language such as "this suggests" or "I can't say for sure"? It would drive me insane because I believed that writing that made an impact doesn't need this extra baggage surrounding statements.

Before then, I was reading a lot of material on domains such as design, writing, and generally creating some type of art. What this meant was that the goal was to _connect_ with the audience, and this was best done in direct language. There was no need to say things in a roundabout way. Instead, the artist could take a direct stab at the issue and touch the person viewing the piece. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/08/31/qualifying-language/" title="Permanent Link: Qualifying Language" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
