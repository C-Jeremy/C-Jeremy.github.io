When something goes wrong, it&#8217;s easy to to point to reasons why you did not perform to your expectation. In fact, the tendency I&#8217;ve seen is that the _more_ you look for reasons, the more you will find them. This is one of our classic mental weaknesses. We search for the data that confirms our suspicions, while dismissing the rest as inconsequential or &#8220;noise&#8221;. What we&#8217;ve done, in essence, is create a situation in which we believe we already _know_ the answer, before we&#8217;ve objectively found it.

When we fail, we race to rationalize what just happened. Why did I under-perform? Did I forget to say something, or forget a crucial fact? Did I do things in the wrong order? These questions will swirl around in our minds immediately after we&#8217;ve failed. And then, our minds try to find reasons that we didn&#8217;t accomplish what was expected. However, we have this horrible tendency to seek external reasons for our failures, instead of going back and questioning what we already did. As soon as the above questions enter our minds, the responses that are generated usually have to do with external conditions, or something out of our control. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/05/16/pointing-fingers/" title="Permanent Link: Pointing Fingers" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
