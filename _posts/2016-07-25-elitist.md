If you&#8217;ve ever considered yourself an expert (or at least, better than average) at an activity, you&#8217;ve likely felt this. It&#8217;s the feeling of hearing someone talk about the activity you know so well, and knowing that they have little idea of what they are talking about compared to yourself. When this happens, I immediately start thinking about how much better I would be at in explaining a concept.

This is an elitist attitude, plain and simple. I don&#8217;t regard it as a good thing, but I feel like this quite often.

For example, I am a runner that runs quite often (about 110km per week), and so I almost immediately begin shaking my head when someone gives &#8220;expert&#8221; advice when they themselves only run twenty kilometres a week. When this happens, I become incredulous, wondering how they can respond with such suggestions when they barely run to begin with. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/25/elitist/" title="Permanent Link: Elitist" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
