If you ever want to feel small, try climbing up a mountain. It&#8217;s during times like these that I feel like my journey is huge, almost impossible.

When I&#8217;m at the bottom, the mountain feels insurmountable, its peak rising in the air so high that it towers over the rest of the area. At the bottom, there&#8217;s a slight fear present. _Can I do this?_

Whereas at the top, _I_ now feel insurmountable. I&#8217;ve conquered the mountain with my own two legs, and it feels incredible. Furthermore, the fear I had at the bottom seems ridiculous. Of _course_ I was able to climb the mountain!

What changed as I climbed the mountain? <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/06/27/mountains/" title="Permanent Link: Mountains" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
