You are made of atoms. Within these atoms, electrons abound. In fact, electrons are some of the most important particles for you to be here. Life is just a way to move electrons from one place to another. When you eat food, the electrons that make up the food get transferred to atoms that go to fueling your body. Your cells need to exchange electrons while working. Electrons are everywhere, moving around as life goes on.

It's a beautiful thought. With all of this complexity that makes up human life, when we get down to it, we're just a bunch of electrons moving around.

A related question: how many electrons does it take before we go from inanimate matter to matter that can think? The answer is bounded from above by the number of electrons in a human (which is a lot). You can look [here](https://foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Ch03_1.php) for an estimate of the number of atoms in a body, and do the rest of the calculation.
