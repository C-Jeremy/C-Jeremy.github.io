One of the professions in which I hold in highest esteem is that of the teacher. A good teacher is simply the best tool for the development of children. A fantastic teacher can truly _shape_ the future of a student in ways that both the student and the teacher cannot even imagine. Because of this, being a teacher is a big responsibility; not only to teach students the material that they are fluent in, but also to probe students&#8217; interests and attempt to find what they would be adept at. Then, a great teacher will push the students in the proper direction to further each students&#8217; goals.

I&#8217;ve had multiple teachers in my life that have shaped who I am and how I look at the world today. Not all of them imparted lessons to me that had to do with specific material. Some helped me see a certain idea in a different light, and some were just enjoyable to have. However, the _best_ teachers I have been taught by have several important characteristics. I think each of these characteristics can be related to one teacher we have in the past (hopefully). <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/02/12/teaching/" title="Permanent Link: Teaching" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
