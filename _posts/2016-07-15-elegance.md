Ask any scientist or mathematician, and this is the quality that they would love their solution to have. They want the result to be elegant, simple, and intuitive.

To give you an example, I remember doing a problem in my calculus class which involved using a bunch of trigonometric functions. Naturally, the integral kind of exploded as I worked on it, and the result was super-complicated. However, after applying a bunch of different identities and swapping sines and cosines, the answer came back as simply tangent of theta.

When I got this result, I immediately _knew_ I was right. The result was just too perfect after all that work for it not to be true (of course, this is a bias). Additionally, the answer made me _feel_ good. It was a nice answer to look at, particularly after all the work required to get there. <span class="post-teaser-more">&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://blog-cjeremy.rhcloud.com/2016/07/15/elegance/" title="Permanent Link: Elegance" rel="bookmark">Read more...</br></span></p>
