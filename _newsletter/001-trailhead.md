For a long time, I struggled with finding the perfect creative niche for me. Truth be told, I was torn in several different directions. I'm a physicist interested in crafting explanations that *move* (in both senses of the word). I've been a runner for eight years now. I've written hundred of thousands of words for my blog on topics from running to science to education to performance and habits. And I've been drawing a webcomic called Handwaving for the last few years.
